# If setup.sh (this file) exists, the grading Docker environment will run it
# before your solution. If you need to install extra dependencies, this is the
# best place to do that. (Running setup commands from inside your solution code
# risks confusing the grader, if your setup commands print anything to stdout.)
# If you wanted to install NodeJS, for example, you would uncomment this line:
#
# apt-get install --yes nodejs
