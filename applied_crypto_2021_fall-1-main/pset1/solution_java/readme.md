# Example Java Solution

This Java solution is based on the default project structure created by `gradle
init`. You can run it with `gradle run` or (to avoid polluting stdout with
build logs) `gradle run --quiet`. If you get an error that says `Could not find
method application()`, make sure you're running the latest version of Gradle,
currently v7.2.

If this is your very first time building Java code with a command line tool
like Gradle (i.e. outside of an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ), please seriously
consider using Python for this course instead. The auto-grader needs your code
to be buildable and runnable with command line tools, and the learning curve
for these tools is unfortunately steep. If you're not comfortable on the
command line in general (Bash on macOS/Linux or cmd.exe/PowerShell on Windows),
the learning curve will be _extremely_ steep. All of this is certainly worth
learning if you plan on using Java professionally, but be prepared to spend
more time figuring out build issues than you do actually solving the first
couple problem sets.
